How it works (quick usage):
•	Open Arduino IDE, choose the right USB port, such as "COM3", then select the "Tools"-"serial plotter"
•	Open Serial Monitor at 115200 baud (from the drop-down).
•	Type a line with frequency, pulse width, and duration (units optional).
•	It immediately starts stimulation and echoes the parsed settings.
•	Send x or stop during stimulation to abort; send s to repeat the last parameters.
•	Type help for examples.
type commands like to trigger the laser stimulation [frequency (Hz), pulse width (ms), duration (s)]:
•	20Hz,5ms,10s
•	1 Hz 10 ms 1 s
•	40 2 5 (defaults to Hz, ms, s)
